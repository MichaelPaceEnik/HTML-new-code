# HTML-new-code
Its my first attempt at making a source code for a website based on the HTML format

Day 1:

Okay here is my code........

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Why Are You Here?</title> 
</head>
<body>
<h1>If You're Looking For Dank Memes You're In The Right Place.. If You Don't Know What That Is I Advise You To Leave...</h1>
<p> This website will get pretty stereotypical depending on mainly JOKES EMPHASIS ON THE JOKES, it is all saterical in order to come together and realize how bad it really is that we analyze typical natures of humans depicting upon their physical looks... This is not meant to offend anyone and if you are easily offended or even get offended after a while I advise you to leave, no disrespect intended to anyone but heres a fair warning</p>
<p> There is going to be the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Black People Jokes</li>
<li>Mexican People Jokes</li>
<li>White People Jokes</li>
<li>Asian People Jokes</li>
<li>NO Arab People Jokes</li>
<li>A Lot Of Messed Up Jokes</li>
<li>Dank Memes</li>
</ol>
</body>
</html>
