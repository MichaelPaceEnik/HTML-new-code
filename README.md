<h3>Some of the main physical featurs found in objects to categorize and identify them are the following:</h3>

<h3>(KAHN duhk TIV uh tee) is the rate at which a substance transfers heat. Plastic foam is a poor conductor, Metal is a excellent conductor.</h3>
<h1>State</h1>
<h3>The physical form in which a substance exists, such as a solid, liquid, or gas. Ice is water in the solid state.</h3>
